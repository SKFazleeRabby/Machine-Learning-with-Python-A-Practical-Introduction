# Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction (IBM)

This course dives into the basics of **Machine Learning** using an approachable, and well-known programming language Python.  This course will be reviewing two main components:

1. the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
2. a general overview of Machine Learning topics, such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. 

In this course, we will practice with real-life examples of Machine Learning and see how it affects society in ways we may not have guessed!

By just putting in a few hours a week for the next several weeks, we'll gain:

- new skills to add to your resume, such as Regression, Classification, Clustering, Sci-kit Learn and SciPy 
- new projects that you can add to your portfolio, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and many more.
- a certificate in machine learning to prove your competency, and share it anywhere you like online or offline, such as LinkedIn profiles and social media.
