# Machine Learning with Python: A Practical Introduction (IBM)


## Introduction
This course dives into the basics of **Machine Learning** using an approachable, and well-known programming language Python.  This course will be reviewing two main components:

1. the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
2. a general overview of Machine Learning topics, such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. 

In this course, we will practice with real-life examples of Machine Learning and see how it affects society in ways we may not have guessed!

By just putting in a few hours a week for the next several weeks, we'll gain:

- new skills to add to your resume, such as Regression, Classification, Clustering, Sci-kit Learn and SciPy 
- new projects that you can add to your portfolio, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and many more.
- a certificate in machine learning to prove your competency, and share it anywhere you like online or offline, such as LinkedIn profiles and social media.

## Learning Objectives
**In this course, we will:**

- Explore examples of Machine Learning and the libraries and languages used to create them.
- Apply the appropriate form of regression to a data set for estimation.
- Apply an appropriate classification method for a particular Machine Learning challenge.
- Use the correct clustering algorithms on different data sets.
- Explain how recommendation systems work, and implement one on a data set.
- Demonstrate your understanding of Machine Learning in an assessed project.

## Projects Covered
Through-out the project, we will be covering 10 different projects to get a hands-on experience in Machine Learning using Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn. The projects that we will complete are:
#### Regression
1. Prediction of CO2 Emission from Cars based on the attributes of Vehicle using Regression.
#### Classification
1. Classifying the types of customer for a Telecommunication service provider based on the demographic data of users.
2. Prescribing Medicine based on the historical data of the patients using Classification.
3. Probablity of a Customer leaving a Telecommunication provider in the next month based on the demographic information of users.
4. Predicting if a Tumor is Malignent or Benign using Support Vector Machine.
#### Clustering
1. Customer Segmentation using Clustering.
2. Grouping the models of cars using Hirarchical Clustering.
3. Clustering the Weather Stations in Canadad based on the weather similarties.
#### Recommendation 
1. Movie Recommendation System based on Content Based Filtering.
2. Movie Recommendation System based on Collaborative Filtering.
